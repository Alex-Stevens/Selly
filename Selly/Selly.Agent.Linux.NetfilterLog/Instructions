Get the library of the netfilter website.

 - You need to build and install the dependencies first

 ./autogen
./configure
make
make install (sudo)

You may need to install any missing tools from apt.
pkg-config - Failure to install this will give you a 'syntax errror' - see https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10220946/pkg-check-modules-considered-harmful
You may need to rerun ./autogen, ./configure, etc, etc after installing one of the dependencies

Libraries have been installed in:
   /usr/local/lib

If you ever happen to want to link against installed libraries
in a given directory, LIBDIR, you must either use libtool, and
specify the full pathname of the library, or use the '-LLIBDIR'
flag during linking and do at least one of the following:
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_LIBRARY_PATH' environment variable
     during execution
   - add LIBDIR to the 'LD_RUN_PATH' environment variable
     during linking
   - use the '-Wl,-rpath -Wl,LIBDIR' linker flag
   - have your system administrator add LIBDIR to '/etc/ld.so.conf'

See any operating system documentation about shared libraries for
more information, such as the ld(1) and ld.so(8) manual pages.


libtool --mode=link gcc -L/usr/local/lib  main.c -o main -lnetfilter_log
iptables -I INPUT -j NFLOG --nflog-group 1
iptables -D INPUT 1

You may need to reload the loaders config, otherwise it may not find the dll/so when you try and run the program.
Use sudo ldconfig.
